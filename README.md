# Login System

Throughout my journey of learning the MERN stack, I've developed a straightforward login system using Node.js, EJS, and JavaScript. This system allows users to log in and access their personalized dashboard, which is tailored to their name. Additionally, users have the option to log out when they're finished.

This login system serves as a foundational component for user authentication and authorization within web applications. It demonstrates the integration of backend (Node.js) and frontend (EJS and JavaScript) technologies to create a seamless user experience.

Key functionalities of the system include:

1. **User Authentication**: Users can securely log in using their credentials.
2. **Personalized Dashboard**: Upon successful login, users are directed to a dashboard that displays content relevant to them, customized based on their name or other user-specific data.
3. **Logout Mechanism**: Users can easily log out of their accounts to ensure security and privacy.

By implementing this login system, I've gained valuable experience in handling user authentication and session management in web development. It's a foundational step towards building more complex and secure applications using the MERN stack.
